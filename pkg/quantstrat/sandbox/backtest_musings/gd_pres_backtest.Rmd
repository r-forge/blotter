abstract: Analysts and portfolio managers face many challenges in developing new systematic
  trading systems.  This paper provides a detailed, repeatable process to aid in evaluating
  new ideas, developing those ideas into testable hypotheses, measuring results in
  comparable ways, and avoiding and measuring the ever-present risks of over-fitting.

Backtesting, art or science?
=========================================================

*Back-testing. I hate it –- it's just optimizing over history. You never see a bad back-test. Ever. In any strategy.* - Josh Diedesch [-@Diedesch2014] CalSTRS

*Every trading system is in some form an optimization*. - Emilio Tomasini [-@Tomasini2009]

Moving Beyond Assumptions
=============================

Many system developers consider "*I hypothesize that this strategy idea will make money*" to be adequate.

- understand your business constraints and objectives
- build a hypothesis for the system
- build the system in pieces
- test the system in pieces
- measure how likely it is that you have overfit 

Constraints and Objectives
=============================

###Constraints

- capital available
- products you can trade
- execution platform

###Benchmarks

- published or synthetic?
- what are the limitations?
- are you held to it, or just measured against it?

###Objectives

- formulate objectives for testability
- make sure they reflect your real business goals

Building a Hypothesis
=============================
*Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful*. - George Box [-@Box1987]

To create a testable idea (a hypothesis), we need to:

\par

\par

- formulate a declarative conjecture
- make sure the conjecture is predictive
- define the expected outcome
- describe means of verifying (testing) the outcome

Building Blocks

Definitions
=============================
\fontsize{8}{1.5}\selectfont

### Filters

- select the instruments to trade
- may be part of the hypothesis
- categorize market characteristics that are favorable to the strategy

### Indicators

- quantitative values derived from market data
- includes all common "technicals" such as moving averages, relative value, etc.

### Signals

- describe the interaction between filters, market data, and indicators
- can be viewed as a prediction at a point in time

### Rules

- make path-dependent actionable decisions



Test the System in Pieces, or, How to Screw Up Less
=============================
*Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise*. - John Tukey [-@Tukey1962] p. 13

\begin{center}
Fail quickly, think deeply, or both?
\end{center}

*No matter how beautiful your theory, no matter how clever you are or what your name is, if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong*. - Richard P. Feynman [-@Feynman1965]

Things to Watch Out For, or, Types of Overfitting
=============================

### Look Ahead Bias

- directly using knowledge of future events

### Data Mining Bias

- caused by testing multiple configurations and parameters over multiple runs, with adjustments between backtest runs
- exhaustive searches may or may not introduce biases

### Data Snooping

- knowledge of the data set can contaminate your choices
- making changes after failures without having strong experimental design 

Measuring Indicators
=============================

A good indicator is describing some measurable aspect of reality: 
a theoretical "fair value" price, or the impact of a factor on that price,
or turning points of the series, or slope.

- hypothesis and tests for the indicator
- custom 'perfect foresight' models
- lessons from signal processing: symmetric filters

If your indicator doesn't have testable information content, throw it out and start over.

Measuring Signals
=============================

\columnsbegin
\column{.45\textwidth}

Signals make predictions; all the literature on forecasting is applicable:

- mean squared forecast error, BIC, etc.
- box plots or additive models for forward expectations
- "revealed performance" approach of @Racine2009
- re-evaluate assumptions about the method of action of the strategy
- detect information bias or luck before moving on

Measuring Rules
=============================
\begin{center}
If your signal process doesn't have predictive power, stop now.
\end{center}

  - rules should refine the way the strategy 'listens' to signals
  - entries may be passive or aggressive, or may level or pyramid into a position
  - exits may have their own signal process, or may be derived empirically
  - risk rules should be added near the end, for empirical 'stops' or to meet business constraints

Parameter Optimization

\begin{center}
Proper formulation of your business objective is critical to results.
\end{center}

Beware of Rule Burden
=============================

- having too many rules is an invitation to overfitting
- adding rules after being disappointed in backtest results is almost certainly an exercise in overfitting (data snooping)
- strategies with fewer rules are more likely to be robust out of sample

Measuring the Whole System
=============================

*Net profit as a sole evaluation method ignores many of the characteristics important to this decision*. - Robert @Pardo2008

Using Trade Statistics
=============================

\fontsize{11}{1.5}\selectfont

All trading and backtesting platforms (should) provide trade statistics:

  - number of trades w/ gross and net P\&L 
  - mean/median, standard deviation of trading P\&L per trade 
  - percent of positive/negative trades  
  - Profit Factor : absolute value ratio of gross profits over gross losses 
  - Drawdown statistics 
  - start-trade drawdown [@Fitschen2013, p. 185]
  - win/loss ratios of winning over losing trade P&L (total/mean/median) 

Dangers of aggregate statistics:

  - hiding the most common outcomes
  - focusing on extremes
  - not enough trades or history for validity
  - collinearities of overlapping "trades" 

Using Returns
=============================

- Returns create a *standard* mechanism for comparing 
multiple strategies or managers
- Choice of the denominator matters

Sample Analyses:

- tail risk measures
- volatility analysis
- factor analysis / factor model monte carlo
- style analysis
- comparing strategies in return space
- applicability to asset allocation

Asset Allocation
=============================

- we tend to do asset allocation studies only after strategies are in production.

- backtests are most often done on 1-lots, and initial scaling is done ad-hoc.

- strategy daily returns become returns of a synthetic asset (the strategy) as inputs to optimization

- optimizer should use your business objectives as the portfolio objective


Did we over do it?
=========================================================

*A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science*. - Robert Gentleman

Detecting Backtest Overfitting
=============================

- **White's Reality Check** : from @White2000 and @Hansen2005
- **k-fold cross validation** : improves single hold-out 
  model by randomly dividing the sample of size *T* into sequential 
  sub-samples of size *T/k*.[ @Hastie2009]
- **CSCV sampling** (combinatorially symmetric cross validation): "generate $S/2$ testing sets of size $T/2$ 
  by recombining the $S$ slices of the overall sample of size $T$ ". [@Bailey2014probability, p.17]
- **Multiple Hypothesis Testing** looks at Type I vs Type II error in evaluating 
  backtests and at appropriate haircuts based on these probabilities. [@Harvey2013backtesting ; -@Harvey2013multiple ; -@Harvey2014 ]


Conclusion & Questions
=========================================================

- understand the business context you operate in 
    - constraints
    - benchmarks
    - objectives
- separate the components of the strategy
- construct testable hypotheses at each step of the process
- evaluate the components separately
- test yourself often
