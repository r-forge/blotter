abstract: Analysts and portfolio managers face many challenges in developing new systematic trading systems.  This paper provides a detailed, repeatable process to aid in evaluating new ideas, developing those ideas into testable hypotheses, measuring results in comparable ways, and avoiding and measuring the ever-present risks of over-fitting. ^[*Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful*. - George Box[-@Box1987] ]

# Constraints, Benchmarks, and Objectives 

It is important to understand what you are trying to achieve 
*before* you set out to achieve it.  

Without a set of clearly defined goals there is great potential to 
accept a strategy or backtest that is really incompatible with the
(previously unstated) business objectives and constraints.
Worse, it can lead to adjusting your goal to try to follow the 
backtest, which can culminate in all sorts of bad decision making, and also
increases the probability of erroneously accepting an overfitted backtest.

## Understanding your business constraints (and advantages)

Think about the constraints, costs, and advantages that you are under
first, before formulating a hypothesis, or writing a strategy specification.
Many strategists skip this step.  Don't.  It is a waste of time and 
energy to design a strategy for a constraint set that is not available to you.

Some examples include:

  - execution platform
  - access and proximity to markets
  - products you can trade
  - data availability and management
  - business structure
  - capital available 
  - fees/rebates


## Choosing a benchmark {#benchmarks}

The choice of what benchmarks to measure yourself against provides both
opportunities for better understanding your performance and risks of
benchmark chasing and overfitting.
Mutual Fund managers have it easy, or hard, because of the "Morningstar"
categorization of styles and benchmarks.  Mutual fund managers have 
benchmarks clearly defined, and can be easily measured against what are 
often exchange traded products or well known indices.  
A good suite of benchmarks for your strategy should reflect your business
objectives and constraints, as well as help you measure performance over
time.

## What constitutes a good benchmark for a trading strategy?  

There are several categories of potential benchmarks:

1. archetypal strategies

    In many cases, you can use a well-known archetypal strategy 
    as a benchmark.  For example, a momentum strategy could use 
    an MA-cross strategy as a benchmark.  
    If you are comparing two or more candidate indicators or 
    signal processes, you can also use one as a benchmark for 
    the other (more on this later).
   
2. alternative indices

    EDHEC, Barclays, HFR, and others offer alternative investment 
    style indices. One of these may be a good fit as a benchmark 
    for your strategy.  Be aware that they tend to have a downward 
    bias imposed by averaging, or are even averages of averages.
    So 'beating the benchmark' in your backtest would be a bare
    minimum first step if using one of these as your benchmark.
    As an example, many CTA's are trend followers, so a momentum 
    strategy in commodities may often be fairly compared to a
    CTA index. 
   
3. custom tracking portfolios  

    In some ways an extension of (1.) above, you can create your 
    own benchmark by creating a custom tracking portfolio.
    As the most common example, a cap-weighted index is 
    really a strategy archetype.  The tracking portfolio for such
    an index invests in a basket of securities using a capitalization 
    as the weights for the portfolio,and rebalances this portfolio on 
    the schedule defined in the index specification.
    Other custom tracking portfolios or synthetic strategies 
    may also be appropriate for measuring your strategy against.
   
4. market observables  
   
    Market observable benchmarks are perhaps the simplest 
    available benchmarks, and can tie in well 
    to business [objectives](#objective) and 
    to [optimization](#optimization).
   
    Some easily observable benchmarks in this category:
   
    - $/day, %/day
    - $/contract
    - % daily volume
    - % open interest
   
## measuring performance against your benchmark

Good benchmarks help to provide insight into the drivers of strategy returns.

Choosing more than one benchmark can help to guard against 
targeting the benchmark (a form of overfitting).
Identifying specific limitations of your benchmarks, for example:

 - lack of goodness of fit, 
 - a different investible universe, 
 - lack of stationarity, 
 - or specific representative features of the benchmark 
 
can also assist in refining the choice of benchmarks
and avoiding taking them too seriously.  

No matter what benchmarks you pick, if you are going to share 
these benchmarks with outside investors or other members of your
team, you need to be careful that you understand and disclose 
the limitations of the benchmark(s) that you've chosen.  
Failure to disclose known divergences from a benchmark you will 
be measured against may look like a limitation rather than a 
feature, so be sure to explain why differences should exist.

You *will* be measured by others against these benchmarks for 
performance, style drift, etc. so failure to disclose known
limitations of your benchmark(s) will waste everyone's time. 

Large bodies of research have been built up over time about how to 
measure performance against such benchmarks. *TrackingError*,
*SharpeRatio*'s, *FactorAnalytics*, and more are well 
represented in **R**.  

## Choosing an Objective {#objectives}

In strategy creation, it is very dangerous to start without a clear
objective.  

Market observable benchmarks (see above) may form the core of 
the first objectives you use to evaluate strategy ideas.  

Your business objective states the types of returns you require for your 
capital, your tail risk objectives, the amount of leverage you intend to 
or are willing to use, and your drawdown constraints (which are closely 
related to the leverage you intend to employ). 

Some of these may be dictated by the constraints your business structure 
has (see above).
For example, leverage constraints generally have a hard limit imposed 
by the entity you are using to access the market, whether that is a 
broker/dealer, a 106.J membership, a leased seat, a clearing member,
or a customer relationship.  Drawdown constraints have hard limits dictated
by the leverage you intend to employ: 10:1 leverage imposes a 10% hard 
drawdown constraint, 4:1 imposes a 25% drawdown constraint, and so on.

Often, there will also be certain return objectives below which a strategy 
is not worth doing.

Ideally, the business objectives for the strategy will be specified as
ranges, with minimum acceptable, desired target, and maximum acceptable or
plausible targets.

Once you have these objectives described, you need to formulate them so that 
they may be easily used to programmatically evaluate your strategy.
^[**FIXME** *we need a version of constrained_objective() from PortA in quantstrat*]

\newthought{Formulate your business objectives} in the same form commonly 
used in portfolio optimization:

 *maximize some measure of return *
 
 *subject to *
 
 *minimizing one or more measures of risk *
 
The most commonly used objective of this type is the Sharpe Ratio 
which is most often calculated as mean return over volatility.
  
Many other modified Sharpe-style ratios also exist:

* Information Ratio: annualized return over annualized risk
* Profit factor: gross profits divided by gross losses
* Sortino Ratio: (annualized return - risk free) over downside volatility
* Calmar Ratio: annualized return  over max drawdown
* return over expected tail loss

All of these ratios have the properties that you want to 
maximize them in optimization, and that they are roughly comparable 
across different trading systems.

Additional properties of the trading system that you may target 
when evaluating strategy performance but which we would not put into the
category of *business requirements* include:

 * correlation to perfect profit
 * slope of the equity curve
 * linearity of the equity curve
 * trade statistics
 etc.
 
A strategy conceptualized as a diversifier for an 
existing suite may well have different business objectives from a strategy
designed to enter a new market or replicate published research or 
take advantage of a transient market opportunity. 
As such, it is further important to be aware that business objectives 
are likely to differ from one strategy to another even inside the same 
organization or on the same team.  
 
Understanding your constraints, benchmarks, and objectives prior to 
embarking on hypothesis generation or strategy creation and evaluation 
will anchor your goals.  Defining these in advance will allow you to 
quickly reject ideas that are incompatible with your goals and requirements.
Proceeding without understanding the milieu in which the proposed
strategy will operate risks overfitting and sloppy analysis, and
should be avoided whenever possible.

# Hypothesis Driven Development ^[*Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise*. - John Tukey [-@Tukey1962] p. 13 ]
Strategy creation is expensive in time (for research) 
and money (for implementation into a live trading environment).

To maximize return on that investment, we follow a hypothesis driven 
approach that allows us to confirm ideas quickly, 
reject failures cheaply, and avoid many of the dangers of overfitting.

Ideas generated via a brainstorming session are a useful starting 
point, but they are typically not testable on their own.

## creating good (testable) hypotheses

To create a testable idea (a hypothesis), we need to:

- formulate the idea as a declarative conjecture
- make sure the conjecture is predictive
- define the expected outcome of that conjecture
- describe means of verifying (testing) the expected outcome

Many ideas will fail the process at this point.  The idea will be 
intriguing or interesting, but not able to be formulated as a conjecture.  
Or, once formatted as a conjecture, you won't be able to 
formulate an expected outcome.  Often, the conjecture is a statement
about the nature of markets.  This may be an interesting, and 
even verifiable point, but not be a *prediction* about market behavior. 
So a good conjecture also makes a prediction, or an observation that 
amounts to a prediction.  The prediction must specify either a cause, 
or an observable state that precedes the predicted outcome.

Finally, a good hypothesis must specify its own test(s). It should describe
how the hypothesis will be verified. A non-testable "working hypothesis" is a 
starting point for further investigation, but the goal has to be to specify tests.  
In some cases, it is sufficient to describe a test of the
prediction. We'll cover specific tests in depth later in this document. In
statistical terms, we need the hypothesis to have a testable dependent
variable.   In other cases it may be necessary to describe a statistical test
to differentiate the hypothesized prediction from other measurable effects,
or from noise, or factor interactions. Specified tests should identify
measurable things that can help identify the (spurious) appearance of a valid hypothesis.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{hypothesis_process}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Most strategy ideas will be rejected} during hypothesis 
creation and testing.

Many ideas, thoughts, and observations about the state of the markets 
lack sufficient structure to become a testable hypothesis.  While it 
is possible that these ideas are indeed true, unless you can quantify 
the idea into a (dis)provable conjecture, it can't be used to create a 
quantitative strategy with any degree of confidence. Far from being a 
negative thing, this is a good use of your time, and guards against 
prematurely moving on with a fundamentally questionable or just 
plain erroneous idea.  The faster an untestable idea can be set aside 
for more verifiable ideas, the better.

\newthought{Proceeding without a hypothesis risks ruin.} Many strategists 
will still try to skip robust hypotheses in favor of sloppy ones such
as "I hypothesize that this strategy idea will make money".  While the value
of testing a more rigorous hypothesis should be clear, it may be more 
difficult to see the risks imposed by having no hypothesis or a sloppy or
incomplete hypothesis.  An incomplete or otherwise deficient hypothesis at this 
stage will create a strong desire to "refine" the hypothesis later by adding
new explanatory statements.  This is called an "ad hoc hypothesis", where
new hypotheses are piled on top of old to better "explain" observation.
(@Carroll2011 , p. 7 or online; see also "rule burden", below) 
Engaging in the creation of ad hoc hypotheses risks ruin, as the 
in-sample explanatory power of the model will seem to go up, while the
out of sample power goes down.  It also invites going over the data 
multiple times while the model is "refined", introducing progressively 
more data snooping bias.

# Defining the strategy

A trading strategy or investment approach is more than just 
a testable hypothesis.
 
After creating and confirming a hypothesis, you need to specify the strategy.
The **R** package *quantstrat* formalizes the strategy structure into 
*filters*, *indicators*, *signals*, and *rules*.

\newthought{Filters} help to select the instruments to trade.  
They may be part of the formulated hypothesis, or they may be 
market characteristics that allow the rest of the strategy to
trade better.  In fundamental equity investing, some strategies 
consist only of filters.  For example, the StarMine package 
that was bought by Thomson Reuters defines quantitative stock screens.
Lo's Variance Ratio is another measure often used as a filter 
to turn the strategy on or off for particular instruments
(but can also be used as an indicator, since it is time-varying).

\newthought{Indicators} are quantitative values derived from market data.

Indicators have no knowledge of current positions or trades.
  
They are calculated in advance on market data (or on other indicators).
Examples of indicators include moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility bands,
channels, factor models, and theoretical pricing models.

One risk to watch out for when defining your indicators is confusing the 
indicator with the strategy.  The indicator is a description of reality,
a model that describes some aspect of the market, or a theoretical price.
An indicator, on its own, is not a strategy.  The strategy depends on 
interactions with the rest of its components to be fully specified.  
         
\newthought{Signals} describe the interaction between filters, market data, 
and indicators. 

Signal processes describe the desire for an action, 
but the strategy may choose not to act or may not be actionable at the time. 
They include 'classic' things like crossovers and thresholds, 
as well as more complicated interactions between pricing models, other indicators, 
and other signal processes.  It is our experience that signals 
may often interact with other signals, so that final signal is a composite
of multiple things, and the likelihood of actually  placing or modifying 
orders will increase based on the combination of signals.

Like indicators, signals are calculated in advance on market data
while doing research or a backtest.  In production, they are typically calculated 
in a streaming fashion. 

As stated above, it is important to separate the desire for action from the 
action itself. The signal happens only in its own context.  In very simple 
strategies, signal and action may be the same, but in most real strategies 
the separation serves to make clear what analysis can be done to support a
decision, and what needs to be postponed until a path-dependent 
decision is warranted.  
         
\newthought{Rules} make path-dependent actionable decisions.

Rules, in both research/backtesting and in production, are what take input 
from market data, indicators, and signals, and actually take action. 
Entry, Exits, Risk, Profit Taking, and Portfolio Rebalancing are all
rule processes.  Rules are path dependent, meaning that they are aware of 
the current market state, the current portfolio, all working orders,
and any other data available at the time the rule is being evaluated. 

No action is instantaneous, so rules also have a cost in time.  There must 
be some lag between observation (indicator or signal), decision (rule), 
and action (order entry or modification).

## strategy specification document

The strategy specification document is a complete description of the
strategy. A draft covering all components of the strategy should be
completed before any code is written. It describes the business context and
objectives, the hypothesis and tests for that hypothesis, and all the
components of the strategy itself (filters, indicators, signals and rules).
It also needs to describe details such as initial parameter choices and why
those choices were made, and any data requirements (tick, bar, L2, external
data, etc.).

The strategy specification needs to be written at a level sufficient for the
research analyst to write code from. Equally important, it should be
written for review by the investment and risk committees.

One of the key reasons for writing the specification before beginning coding, 
beyond clarity and rigor of thinking, is that it provides another curb against 
overfitting.  Changes to the specification should be deliberate, recorded 
and indicate that something was incomplete or erroneous in the initial 
specification.  The strategy designer will learn from success and failure 
along the development path, and the outcomes of these incremental 
experiments should be clearly reflected in the strategy specification 
and its revision history.

\newthought{Specification changes need to be conscious and recorded.}
Loosely adjusting the specification as you go increases the likelihood 
of an overfit and invalid test.

# Creating the Strategy

Creating the strategy code for backtesting or production is outside the 
scope of this document. In **R** you'll likely use *quantstrat*, and
when transitioning to production, you'll use whatever execution platforms
are supported by your organization or team.

\newthought{Developing and testing the strategy in stages} using the tools 
described in the following sections makes the strategy development process 
less expensive, more rigorous, and less subject to over-fitting.  This is in 
contrast to the process described by many of the references in this document
which focus *only* on evaluating the entire strategy at once, and modifying
the whole strategy before doing another analytical trial.

# Evaluating the Strategy ^[*No matter how beautiful your theory, no matter how clever you are or what your name is, if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong*. - Richard P. Feynman [-@Feynman1965]]         
 
\newthought{How do you evaluate the backtest?}

Conceptually, the goal should continue to be to reject or fix failures 
quickly, before getting to the point of something that risks feeling too
expensive to throw away.  We want to evaluate the backtest against 
our hypothesis and business objectives.  The earlier in the strategy 
framework we can identify and correct problems, the less likely we are 
to fall victim to common errors in backtesting:
  
\newthought{Look Ahead Biases} are introduced when an analysis directly uses knowledge 
  of future events.  They are most commonly found when using 'corrected'
  or 'final' numbers in a backtest rather than the correct 'vintage' of data.
  Other common examples are using the mean of the entire series, or 
  using only surviving securities in an analysis performed after several 
  candidate securities have been de-listed.  [see @baquero2005]
  Look ahead bias is relatively easily corrected for in backtests by 
  subsetting the data at each step so that indicators, signals, and rules
  only have access to the data that would have been contemporaneously 
  available.  Guarding against vintage or survivorship problems requires 
  slightly more work, as the analyst must be aware that the data being 
  used for the analysis comes in vintages.

\newthought{Data Mining Bias} arises from testing multiple configurations 
  and parameters of a trading system without carefully controlling for the 
  introduction of bias.  It is typically caused by brute force searching 
  of the parameter space without a driving hypothesis for why those parameters 
  would be good candidates.[see @Aronson2006, Chapter 6, pp.287-320]

  Correcting for data mining bias is covered in Aronson, and consists
  mostly in designing the tests such that you do not pollute your data.
  Walk forward analysis (covered later) is a key component of this,
  as are adjustments and measurements of data mining effects after they occur.
  
\newthought{Data snooping} is the process by which knowledge of the data set 
  contaminates your statistical testing (your backtest) because you 
  have already looked at the data.  In an innocuous form, it 
  could occur simply because you have market knowledge. [see @mistakes2011] Tukey 
  called this "uncomfortable science" because of the bias that it can introduce,
  but knowledge of how markets work, and what things have worked in the past
  is an essential part of strategy development.  What you need to be cautious
  of is making changes to the *strategy* to overcome specific deficiencies
  you see in testing.  These types of changes, while sometimes unavoidable 
  and even desirable, increase the probability of overfitting. 

  @Sullivan1999 and @Hansen2005 provide tests derived from White's Reality Check 
  [which is patented in @White2000], to measure the potential impact of data 
  snooping on the backtested results.

\newthought{One deficiency in the strategy literature} is that it has been 
moving towards utilizing parameter optimization, machine learning, or 
statistical classification methods (such as random forests or neural networks) 
as a silver bullet for strategy development.  While a full treatment is beyond 
the scope of this paper, it is worth mentioning that the model assessment 
and selection techniques of the statistical classification and machine learning 
literature are very valid in the context of evaluating trading strategies. 
[see e.g. @Hastie2009, chapters 7 and 8] We advocate extensive use of model 
validation tests, tests for effective number of parameters, and careful use 
of training and cross validation tests in every part of strategy evaluation. 
Of particular utility is the application of these techniques to each 
*component* of the strategy, in turn, rather than or before testing the 
entire strategy model.

\newthought{Defining the objectives, hypotheses, and expected outcome(s)} of the 
experiment (backtest) as declared before any strategy code is written or run 
and evaluating against those goals on an ongoing basis will guard against 
many of the error types described above by discarding results that are not 
in line with the stated hypotheses.

___

# Evaluating Indicators

In many ways, evaluating indicators in a vacuum is harder than evaluating 
other parts of the strategy.  It is nearly impossible if you cannot 
express a theory of action for the indicator.  
*Why?*  This is true because the indicator is not just some analytical 
output that has no grounding (at least we hope not).  A good indicator
is describing some measurable aspect of reality: a theoretical "fair value"
price, or the impact of a factor on that price, or turning points 
of the series, or slope.

If we have a good conceptualization of the hypothesized properties of 
the indicator, we can construct what the signal processing field calls 
the 'symmetric filter' on historical data.  These are often  optimized 
ARMA or Kalman-like processes that filter out all the 'noise' to capture
some pre-determined features of the series.  They're (usually) useless 
for prediction, but are very descriptive of past behavior.

\newthought{How is this useful} in evaluating an indicator?  Once you have constructed 
the symmetric filter, you can evaluate the degree to which the indicator 
matches perfect hindsight.  Using kernel methods, clustering, mean squared error, 
or distance measures we can evaluate the degree of difference between 
the indicator and the symmetric filter.  A low degree of difference (probably)
indicates a good indicator for the features that the symmetric filter has been
tuned to pick up on.

\newthought{The danger of this approach} comes if you've polluted your 
data by going over it too many times. Specifically, if you train the indicator
on the entire data set, then of course it has the best possible fit 
to the data.  Tests for look ahead bias and data snooping bias can help to
detect and guard against that, but the most important guard has to be 
the analyst paying attention to what they are doing, and constructing 
the indicator function or backtest to not use non-contemporaneously 
available data.  Ideally, polluted training periods will be strictly 
limited and near the beginning of the historical series, or something 
like walk forward will be used (sparingly) to choose parameters so
that the parameter choosing process is run over programmatically 
chosen subsets.  Failure to exercise care here leads almost 
inevitably to overfitting (and poor out of sample results). 

It is also possible to evaluate the accuracy of an indicator empirically 
if you can describe the properties in ways that can be readily programmed.  
For example, if the indicator is supposed to indicate turning points, 
and is tuned to a mean duration of ten periods, then you can look for all 
turning points that precede a short term trend centered around ten periods. 
The downside of this type of detailed empirical analysis is that it is 
inherently a one-off process, developed for a specific indicator.

It is also important to be aware of the structural dangers of bars.  Many 
indicators are constructed on periodic or "bar" data.  Bars are not a 
particularly stable analytical unit, and are often sensitive to exact 
starting or ending time of the bar, or to the methodologies used to 
calculate the components (open, high, low, close, volume, etc.) of the bar.
To mitigate these dangers, it is important to test the robustness of the 
bar generating process itself, e.g. by varying the start time of the first 
bar.  We will almost never run complete strategy tests on bar data, preferring
to generate the periodic indicator, and then apply the signal and rules 
processes to higher frequency data. In this way the data used to generate the
indicator is just what is required by the indicator model, with more realistic
market data used for generating signals and for evaluating rules and orders.

The analysis on indicators described here provides another opportunity
to reject your hypothesis, and go back to the drawing board. 


# Evaluating Signals 
From one or more indicators, you usually proceed to examining the effectiveness
of the signal generating process.  One of the challenges in evaluating 
the full backtest is that the backtest needs to make multiple assumptions about fills.
We can evaluate signals without making any assumptions about the execution 
that accompanies the desire to express a particular view.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{boxplot}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{A signal is a directional prediction} for a point in time.  
The point in time indicated for the signal will generally vary based on some
parameterization of the indicator and/or signal function(s).  These may be 
plotted using a forward looking boxplot which lines up returns from the signal 
forward by using the signal as $t_0$, and then displaying a boxplot of period 
returns from $t_{1...n}$. Without any assumptions about execution, we
have constructed a distribution of forward return expectations from the
signal generating process.

Many analyses can be done with this data.  You can take a distribution of 
overall return expectations, generate a conditional return distribution, 
examine a linear or non-linear fit between the period expectations, and compare
the expectations of multiple different input parameters.  When comparing 
input parameter expectations, you should see 'clusters' of similar
positive and/or negative return expectations in similar or contiguous
parameter combinations.  Existence of these clusters indicates 
what @Tomasini2009 refer to as a 'stable region' for the parameters
(see parameter optimization below). 
A random assortment of positive expectations is a bad sign, and should 
lead to reviewing whether your hypotheses and earlier steps are robust.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{gamlss}
\end{marginfigure}

The signals generated by the backtest(s) are also able to be empirically 
classified.  You can measure statistics such as the number of entry and exit 
signals, the distribution of the period between entries and exits, degree of 
overlap between entry and exit signals, and so on.

Given the empirical data about the signal process, it is possible
to develop a simulation of statistically similar processes.  A simulation
of this sort is described by @Aronson2006 for use in evaluating entire
strategy backtest output (more on this below), but it is also useful at this 
earlier stage.  These randomly simulated signal processes should display
(random) distributions of returns, which can be used to assess return bias
introduced by the historical data.  If you parameterize the statistical 
properties of the simulation, you can compare these parameterized simulations
to the expectation generated from each parameterization of the strategy's 
signal generating process.

It is important to separate a parameterized and conditional simulation 
from an unconditional simulation. Many trading system Monte Carlo tools
utilize unconditional sampling.  They then erroneously declare that a good 
system must be due to luck because its expectations are far in the right-hand
tail of the unconditional distribution. One of the only correct inferences that 
you can deduce from a unconditional simulation would be a mean return bias of
the historical series. 

It would make little sense to simulate a system that scalps every tick when 
you are evaluating a system with three signals per week.  It is critical to 
center the simulation parameters around the statistical properties of the 
system you are trying to evaluate.  The simulated signal processes should 
have nearly indistinguishable frequency parameters (number of enter/exit 
signals, holding period, etc.) to the process you are evaluating, to ensure 
that you are really looking at comparable things. 

In the analysis of signal processes, since every signal is a prediction, is
where we can begin to fully apply the literature on model specification
and testing of predictions.  From the simplest available methods such
as mean squared model error or kernel distance from an ideal process, 
through extensive evaluation as suggested for BIC, effective number of 
parameters, and cross validation of @Hastie2009, and including time series 
specific models such as the data driven approach "revealed performance"
approach of @Racine2009, all available tools from the forecasting literature 
should be considered for evaluating proposed signal processes.

It should be clear that evaluating the signal generating process offers 
multiple opportunities to re-evaluate assumptions about the method of
action of the strategy, and to detect information bias or luck before 
moving on to (developing and) testing the rest of the strategy.

# Evaluating Rules 

By the time you get to this stage, you should have experimental confirmation 
that the indicator(s) and signal process(es) provide statistically significant
information about the instruments you are examining.  If not, stop and go back
and reexamine your hypotheses.  Assuming that you do have both a theoretical 
and empirical basis on which to proceed, it is time to define the 
strategy's trading rules.

Much of the work involved in evaluating "technical trading rules" described
in the literature is really an evaluation of signal processes, described 
in depth above.

## entry rules

Most signal processes designed by analysts and described in the literature 
correspond to trade entry.  If the *signal* (prediction) has a positive 
expectation, then the *rule* should have potential to make money.  
It is most likely valuable with any proposed system to test both aggressive 
and passive entry order rules.  If the system makes money in the backtest with 
a passive entry on a signal, but loses money with an aggressive entry which 
crosses the bid-ask spread, or requires execution within a very short time 
frame after the signal, the likelihood that the strategy will work in 
production is greatly reduced.  Conversely, if the system is relatively 
insensitive in the backtest to the exact entry rule from the signal process,
there will likely be a positive expectation for the entry in production.

## exit rules

There are two primary classes of exit rules, signal based and empirical;
evaluation and risks for these two groupings is different. Exit rules, 
whether being driven by the same signal process as the entry
rules, or based on empirical evidence from the backtest, are often the 
difference between a profitable and an unprofitable strategy. 

Signal driven exit rules may follow the same signal process as the entry rules
(e.g. band and midpoints models, or RSI-style overbought/oversold models), or
they may have there own signal process. For example, a process that seeks to 
identify slowing or reversal of momentum may be different from a process to 
describe the formation and direction of a trend. When evaluating signal based 
exits, the same process from above for testing aggressive vs. passive order 
logic is likely valuable.  Additionally, testing trailing order logic after 
the signal may "let the winners run" in a statistically significant manner.

Empirical exit rules are usually identified after initial tests of other 
types of exits, or after parameter optimization (see below).  They include 
classic risk stops (see below) and profit targets, as well as trailing take 
profits or pullback stops.  Empirical profit rule are usually identified 
using the outputs of things like MAE/MFE, for example:

 - if MFE shows that trades that have advanced *x* % or ticks are unlikely 
   to advance further, so the trade should be taken off
 - if a path fit is still strongly positive, even though the signal process
   indicates to be on the lookout for an exit opportunity, so a trailing 
   take profit may be in  order

## risk rules

There are several types of risk rules that may be tested in the backtest, 
and the goals of adding them should be derived from your business objectives.
By the time you get to adding risk rules in the backtest, the strategy should
be built on a confirmed positive expectation for the signal process, 
signal-based entry and exit rules should have been developed and confirmed,
and any empirical profit taking rules should have been evaluated.
There are two additional "risk" rule types that should commonly be considered 
for addition to the strategy, empirical risk stops, and business constraints. 

Empirical risk stops are generally placed such that they would cut off the 
worst losing trades.  This is very strategy dependent.  You may be able to
get some hints from the signal analysis described above, some examples: 

 - if a path fit is strongly negative after putting on the trade
 - if the return slope is negative after *x* periods
 
Or, you may place an empirical risk stop based on what you see after 
doing parameter optimization or post trade analysis (see tools below) to cut
off the trade after there is a very low expectation of a winning trade, 
for example:

 - *x* ticks or % against the entry price
 - in the bottom quantile of MAE
 
The business constraint example we most often see in practice is that of a 
drawdown constraint in a levered portfolio.  The drawdown constraint is a clear 
business requirement, imposed by the leverage in the book.  It is possible to
impose drawdown constraints utilizing a risk rule that would flatten the 
position after a certain loss.  While it is common to use catastrophic loss 
rules in strategies, we have had better luck controlling portfolio drawdowns
via diversified asset allocation and portfolio optimization than via risk stops.

@Bailey2014drawdown examines the impact of drawdown based risk rules, and 
adjustments to order sizing based on drawdowns or other changes in account 
equity. They develop an autoregressive model for estimating the potential 
for drawdowns even in high-Sharpe or short history investments.  They further
model the likely time to recover as investment sizes are varied following 
the drawdown.

It is also possible to model risk rules such as hedges or option insurance, 
but these are best done in asset allocation and money management as an overlay 
for the strategy or a portfolio of strategies, and not in the individual 
strategy itself.  Rules to model orthogonal portfolio hedges or option 
insurance significantly complicate the task of evaluating the impact of the 
rules designed for the regular functioning of the strategy.

As with other parts of strategy development and testing, it is again important
to formulate a hypothesis about the effects of exit rules that you plan to add,
and to document their intended effects, and the business reasons you've chosen
for adding them.  this is especially important if you are adding rules after 
parameter optimization.  Done poorly, exit or risk rules added after parameter 
optimization are just cherry picking the best returns, while if done properly
they may be used to take advantage of what you've learned about the statistical
expectations for the system, and may improve out of sample correspondence to the 
in-sample periods.

## order sizing

We tend to do minimal order sizing in backtests.  Most of our backtests are 
run on "one lot" or equivalent portfolios.  The reason is that the backtest 
is trying to confirm the hypothetical validity of the trading system, not 
really trying to optimize execution beyond a certain point.  How much order
sizing makes sense in a backtest is dependent on the strategy and your 
business objectives. Typically, we will do "leveling" or "pyramiding" studies
while backtesting, starting from our known-profitable business practices.  
We will *not* do "compounding" or "percent of equity" studies, because our
goal in backtesting is to confirm the validity of the positive expectation 
and rules embodied in the system, not to project revenue opportunities.
Once we have a strategy model we believe in, and especially once we have 
been able to calibrate the model on live trades, we will tend to drive order 
sizing from microstructure analysis, post trade analysis of our execution,
and portfolio optimization.

## rule burden

\newthought{Beware of rule burden.} 
Too many rules will make a backtest look excellent in-sample, and may 
even work in walk forward analysis, but are very dangerous in production.
One clue that you are over-fitting by adding too many rules is that
you add a rule or rules to the backtest *after* running an exhaustive 
analysis and being disappointed in the results.  This is introducing 
data snooping bias.  Some data snooping is unavoidable, but if you've 
run multiple parameter optimizations on your training set or (worse)
multiple walk forward analyses, and then added rules after each run,
you're likely introducing dangerous biases in your output.

# Parameter optimization ^[*Every trading system is in some form an optimization.* (Tomasini)]

Parameter optimization is important for indicators, signals, rules, and 
complete trading systems.  Care needs to be taken to do this as safely as 
possible.  That care needs to start with clearly defined objectives, as 
has already been stated.  The goal of parameter optimization should be to 
locate a parameter combination that most closely matches the hypotheses 
and objectives.  To avoid overfitting, it is also critical to avoid outliers,
looking for stable regions of both in and out of sample performance.
[@Tomasini2009 , pp. 49-56]

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{param_region}
\end{marginfigure}

When a parameter or set of parameters is robust, it will have a few key 
properties:

- small parameter changes lead to small changes in P&L and objective 
  expectations
- out of sample deterioration is not large, on average (see walk forward 
  optimization)
- parameter choices have a sound theoretical or economic basis
- parameter variation should produce correlated differences in multiple 
  objectives

For small numbers of parameters, it may be sufficient to graph parameters 
against your objective, use quantiles, or examine neighbors around a 
candidate parameter set.  When there are more than a couple of parameters, 
or more than one objective, the inference to find a "stable region" is 
somewhat more difficult.  Quantiles of the parameter sets lined up against 
the objectives are still useful, but you may need to cluster these values 
to find the best intersection, or apply formal global optimization solvers
with a penalized objective to locate the best combination of parameters.

\newthought{Limiting the degrees of freedom} in your parameter optimization
is another way to guard against overfitting and data mining biases.  
Most real strategies have only a few influential parameters, out of many
other "fine tuning" parameters.  When backtesting, focus on the major drivers.
These major drivers should be known in advance, from the theory 
of the strategy.  If they are not obvious from the theory of the strategy,
first work on refining the hypothesis so its premises may be tested.  If
that is not possible or is still insufficient, effective parameter testing 
[^@Hastie2009] can help to identify the major drivers in a small training and 
testing set from the beginning of the data. By limiting the degrees of 
freedom in this way, you limit the opportunities to cherry pick lucky 
combinations, and statistically the required adjustment for data mining 
bias is reduced, as are the number of trials (resulting in faster 
parameter searches).

\newthought{Incremental evaluation of rules} is another advanced form of 
parameter optimization usually paired with more advanced global optimization 
solvers or machine learning.  Incremental rule evaluation runs the 
strategy with different combinations of rules.  In a normal evaluation 
of this type, rules are separated by type (entry, exit, risk, rebalance, 
and so on), and various combinations are tried, starting with minimal 
enter/exit pairs, and adding incrementally to complexity.  These types
of trials can be very informative as to what adds value to the strategy.  
If not carefully controlled, they can also result in significant out of
sample deterioration (see walk forward analysis).  

\newthought{Choosing the best parameter set} should be a function of 
your business objectives.  In the simplest case, your selection algorithm
should maximize or minimize your business objective.  In more complex cases,
you will likely have multiple business objectives, and will utilize a 
penalized multi-objective optimization to choose the best combination.
In an ideal case, you will also have a view on slope and linearity of the 
equity curve, described by something like Kestner's K-Ratio[-@Kestner2003],
which is really the t-test on the linear model, or by other descriptive
statistics of the goodness of fit.  

# Walk Forward Analysis

A logical extension of parameter optimization, walk forward analysis 
utilizes a rolling or expanding window as 'in-sample' for parameterization
and another period as 'out of sample' using the chosen parameters.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{walk_forward_gantt}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Most strategies do not have stable parameters through time.}
The world's top investors, in all styles and frequencies, adjust their 
expectations, outlook, and approach over time as market conditions change.
Warrent Buffett or Ray Dalio say that they follow the same "strategy" 
over decades, but they still adapt to changing markets.  
Walk forward analysis allows the parameterization of the strategy to 
change over time as market conditions change.

\newthought{Walk forward analysis guards against data mining bias.}
At first, this may be counter-intuitive, as walk forward analysis is a 
data mining process.  
Barring regime shift (more on this later), the strategist generally assumes 
local stationarity in market conditions.  If we are conducting parameter 
optimization in alignment with our previously stated business objectives 
(supplemented by statistical measures of goodness of fit), then
utilizing walk forward analysis describes the strategy parameterization 
that would have been most appropriate for the business at a point in time.
If you are truly in a region of local stationarity in market characteristics,
then you are choosing optimal parameters for your out of sample period
*without* looking ahead and incurring bias.  

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{walk_forward_chart}
\end{marginfigure}

Another guard against data snooping bias is to have your walk forward 
periods be realistic. If the strategy is hard to parameterize, or uses 
hard to get or periodic data, then your walk forward analysis should 
reflect these difficulties. 

For example, you should make sure that you:

- Choose between anchored walk forward or rolling walk forward based 
  on whether the theoretical properties of your indicators(s) would 
  benefit from that.
- Only reparameterize the free parameters for the whole strategy on a 
  frequency that makes sense for your strategy and business.  Indicators 
  that adapt to changes in market data automatically are probably safer 
  than doing frequent parameter searches of the recent past.
- Don't vary the length of in and out of sample periods across multiple 
  tests, unless you are using such variations to model out of sample 
  deterioration.
- If you use macroeconomic data released periodically (monthly or quarterly),
  your in and out of sample periods should reflect when information arrives
  to change how the strategy operates.
- Understand whether windowing effects would strongly influence the results. 
  If windowing effects are present, consider an anchored walk forward.

In addition to the choosing mechanism used for parameter analysis, you may 
additionally evaluate turnover and correspondence between in and out 
of sample performance.  On turnover, you may choose to stay with the 
parameter set you are already running, or the set with the lowest turnover,
if the performance of this zero or low turnover parameter set is within 
the error bounds of the estimation.  If you are utilizing a 
population-based optimizer, it makes sense to evaluate the top performers
from the in-sample period in the out of sample period, and utilize 
the ones with the least drift as part of your starting population for 
your next (non-overlapping) walk forward period.

\newthought{Walk forward analysis should be used sparingly.}  One risk of
using walk forward analysis is that you can introduce data snooping biases 
if you apply it multiple times with differing goals, looking for the best 
outcomes.  As with objective and hypothesis generation, you should be clear 
about the definition of success before performing the test and polluting 
your data set with prior knowledge.  

# Regime Analysis

\newthought{Parameter optimization and walk forward analysis assume local stationarity.}

*How do you know if this is a reasonable assumption?*

Regime models attempt to provide this information.  Many financial time series
exhibit distinct states, with specific properties differing sharply between
these different 'regimes'.  There are two primary classes of models that are 
used for detecting regimes, Markov switching models and change point models. 
In the context of strategy development, it can make sense to both test for 
regime behaviors and develop a plan for managing regime change. If your data
has well-defined regimes, and you can model these, you may find that very 
different parameter sets are appropriate for the strategy in those regimes, 
or that no parameter set produces reasonable results out of sample in 
particularly challenging regimes, or that no change is necessary.  In any
case, once you have a strategy model you believe in, doing some regime 
analysis may provide some additional marginal benefit.

# Evaluating Trades

Entire books have been written extolling the virtues or lamenting the problems 
of one performance measure over another.  We have chosen to take a rather 
inclusive approach both to trade and P&L based measures and to return based 
measures (covered later).  Generally, we run as many metrics as we can, and 
look for consistently good metrics across all common return and cash based 
measures. Trade and P&L based measures have an advantage of being precise 
and reconcilable to clearing statements, but disadvantages of not
being easily comparable between products, after compounding, etc.  

\newthought{What is a trade, anyway?}

The word "trade" has different meanings in different parts and types of 
strategy analysis. Certainly a single transaction is a "trade".  When 
speaking of "trades" in "trade statistics" you usually mean a pair or 
more of transactions that both open and close a position.

There are several ways of calculating the round trip "trades".  The 
most common are FIFO, tax lots, flat to flat, and flat to reduced.

1. FIFO

    FIFO is "first in, first out", and pairs entry and exit transactions by 
    time priority.  We generally do not calculate statistics on FIFO because 
    it is impossible to match P&L to clearing statements; very few 
    institutional investors will track to FIFO.  It can also be very difficult 
    to calculate a cost basis if the quantities of your orders vary, or you 
    get a large number of partial fills.
    
2. tax lots

    Tax lot "trades" pair individual entry and exit transactions together 
    to gain some tax advantage such as avoiding short term gains, harvesting
    losses, lowering the realized gain, or shifting the realized gain or loss 
    to another tax period or tax jurisdiction.  This type of analysis can 
    be very beneficial, though it will be very dependent on the goals of the 
    tax lot construction.
    
3. flat to flat
    
    Flat to flat "trade" analysis marks the beginning of the trade from the
    first transaction to move the position off zero, and marks the end of
    the "trade" with the transaction that brings the P&L back to zero, 
    or "flat".
    It will match brokerage statements of realized P&L when the positions is 
    flat and average cost of open positions always, so it is easy to reconcile 
    production trades using this methodology.  One advantage of the flat to flat 
    methodology is that there are no overlapping "trades" so doing things like
    bootstrap, jackknife, or Monte Carlo analysis on those trades is not 
    terribly difficult. The challenge of using flat to flat is that it will 
    not work well for strategies that are rarely flat; if a strategy adjusts 
    its position up or down, levels into trades, etc. then getting useful 
    aggregate statistics from flat to flat analysis may be difficult.
    
4. flat to reduced

    The flat to reduced methodology marks the beginning of the "trade" from 
    the first transaction to increase the position, and ends a "trade" when
    the position is reduced at all, going closer to zero.  Brokerage 
    accounting practices match this methodology exactly, they will adjust 
    the average cost of the open position as positions get larger or further
    from flat, and will realize gains whenever the position gets smaller 
    (closer to flat). Flat to reduced is our preferred methodology most of the
    time. This methodology works poorly for bootstrap or other trade 
    resampling methodologies, as some of the aggregate statistics are highly 
    intercorrelated because multiple "trades" share the same entry point.
    You need to be aware of the skew in some statistics that may be created
    by this methodology and either correct for it or not use those 
    statistics. Specific problems will depend on the strategy and 
    trading pattern. This method is a good default choice for "trade" 
    definition because it is the easiest to reconcile to statements, other 
    execution and analysis software, and accounting and regulatory standards.
   
   
\newthought{Aggregate trade statistics are calculated on the entire backtest.}

Basically all modern backtesting and execution platforms can calculate and 
report aggregated trade statistics for the entire test period. Typically,
you will be looking at these statistics to confirm that the performance of 
the strategy is as expected for it's class, and in-line with the expectations 
you established from the components of the strategy. 

+ common trade statistics :
    - number of transactions and "trades" performed 
    - gross and net trading profits/losses (P\&L) 
    - mean/median trading P\&L per trade 
    - standard deviation of trade P\&L 
    - largest winning/losing trade 
    - percent of positive/negative trades  
    - Profit Factor : absolute value ratio of gross profits over gross losses 
    - mean/median P\&L of profitable/losing trades 
    - annualized Sharpe-like ratio 
    - max drawdown 
    - win/loss ratios of winning over losing trade P&L (total/mean/median) 


Some authors advocate testing the strategy against "perfect profit", the 
potential profit of buying every upswing and selling every downswing. 
Such a "perfect profit" number is meaningless in almost all circumstances,
as it relies on a number of assumptions of periodicity, execution technology, 
etc. that are certain to be false.  While it would be possible to create an 
"ideal profit" metric for a given strategy which would have similar stochastic
entry/exit properties to the strategy being evaluated, our assertion is that 
this type of simulation is more appropriately situated with analysis of
the signal process, as described above.  It is certainly possible to extend 
the signal analysis as described above to a given fixed set of rules, but 
we believe this is an invitation to overfitting, and prefer to only perform
that kind of speculative analysis inside the structure of a defined 
experimental design such as parameter optimization, walk forward analysis, 
or *k*-fold cross validation on strategy implementations, and leave the 
simulated data much earlier in the process when confirming the power of the
strategy components.

The goal of many trading strategies is to produce a smoothly upward sloping 
equity curve.  To compare the output of your strategy to an idealized 
representation, most methodologies utilize linear models.  The linear fit 
of the equity curve may be tested for slope, goodness of fit, and confidence
bounds. @Kestner2003 proposes the K-Ratio, which is the p-test statistic on 
the linear model.  @Pardo2008 (pp. 202-209) emphasizes the number of trades, 
and the slope of the resulting curve.  You can extend the analysis beyond 
the simple linear model to generalized linear models or generalized additive 
models, which can provide more robust fits that do not vary as much with small 
changes to the inputs.

**Dangers of aggregate statistics ...**

- hiding the most common outcomes
- focusing on extremes
- not enough trades or history for validity
- colinearities of flat to reduced


\newthought{Per-Trade statistics can provide insight for fine-tuning.}

Analyzing individual trades can give you insight into how the strategy 
performs on a very fine-grained level.

Especially for path dependent behaviors such as:

- developing a distribution of trade performances and volatilizes,
- validating the signal expectations, which were inherently forward looking,
- quick dips or run-ups immediately after the trade is put on, 
- frequent drawdowns from peak before taking the trade off, 
- positive or negative excursions while the trade is on.

Analyzing excursions can provide empirical support from the backtest for 
setting risk stops or profit taking levels.
    \begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{MAE}
    \end{marginfigure}
Maximum Adverse Excursion or Maximum Favorable Excursion show how far 
down (or up) every trade went during the course of its lifecycle.  You 
can capture information on how many trades close close to their highs or lows,
as well as evaluating points at which the P&L for the trade statistically
just isn't going to get any better, or isn't going to recover.  While
not useful for all strategies, many strategies will have clear patterns that
may be incorporated into risk or profit rules.

You can also separate the individual trades into quantiles (or other slices)
by any statistic that you have available.  The different distributions,
paths, and properties of these quantiles will frequently provide insight into 
methods of action in the strategy, and can lead to further strategy development.

# Post Trade Analysis

Post trade analysis offers an opportunity to calibrate the things you learned 
in the backtest, and generate more hypotheses for improving the strategy. 
Analyzing fills may proceed using all the tools described earlier in this 
document. Additionally, you now have enough data to model slippage from the
model prices, as well as any slippage (positive or negative) from the 
other backtest statistics.

One immediate benefit for post trade analysis is that you already have all 
the tools to evaluate performance; they have been applied to every component 
of the strategy.  Tests and output of all the analyses are already specified,
and may be compared directly.

\newthought{Some analysis is unique to post trade analysis.}
Direct reconciliation between the backtest and production requires both the 
theoretical and production output have all the same information available for 
modeled prices, orders, and execution reports.  Once in the same format,
it is possible to analyze variances in:

- modeled theoretical price (these should match in most cases)
- order timing and prices
- P&L
- evolution of the position, including partial fill analysis

Backtests tend to model complete fills, and use deliberately conservative 
fill assumptions. One outcome of this is that many strategies can receive 
more or earlier fills in production.  If you've modeled your signal 
expectations, these may be run over the production period as well, and 
you can develop a model for when and how completely fills occur in production 
after the signals and rules of the model would have wanted to be filled.  
You can also model slippages at this point, in price, quantity, and time.

Our practice is to impose haircuts on the research model based on production 
results.  All negative results, whether the fault of the model or of
execution, will be used to lower the backtest expectations on future
trials.  All positive production results will be appropriately celebrated, 
but will not be used to 'upward adjust' the model.

Reconciliation of the differences will often lead to improvements in
the strategy, or its production execution.

___
#Microstructure Analysis 

\newthought{Microstructure can not be easily tested in a backtest.}
The nature of backtesting is that you want to try many combinations quickly.  
As such, the data you use for a backtest is almost always at least minimally 
reduced from full L2 market data.  If you have a desire or a need to 
formulate an opinion about how the strategy will perform given market 
microstructure, this will be very hard to simulate, even from full L2 data.
While simulators exist for L2 data that are quite accurate most of those
are stochastic, very computationally intensive, and need to be run 
hundreds or thousands of times with minor variations in assumptions and 
timing.  

Some things can be known from the L2 data without a simulator:

- distribution or composition of the book
- likelihood that the market will turn to a new price
- total shown size for a given level at a certain point in time

To refine expectations of execution, you have to gather real trade data.  
By doing post trade analysis (see above) you can line up orders and fills 
with the L1 or L2 book data, dealing with things like jitter and skew in the 
timestamps.  You can then draw inferences about likelihoods of getting 
filled, market impact, how your MAE/MFE and other trade statistics relate 
to the backtest.

When much of the overall net performance of the strategy depends on 
the execution the only way to refine that expectation is to gather 
real data on the target system, or to use an informative prior 
constructed from a similar system that was or is actually traded 
in production.  When you know that the signal process has a positive
expectation, and a reasonable backtest also shows a positive expectation,
one of the best ways to adjust the theoretical expectation is to 
calibrate it against the output of post trade analysis.

# Probability of Overfitting ^[*A big computer, a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science. - Robert Gentleman*]

\newthought{This entire paper has been devoted to avoiding overfitting.}
At the end of the modeling process, we still need to evaluate how likely 
it is that the model may be overfit, and develop a haircut for the model
that may identify how much out of sample deterioration could be expected.

All strategy models are to one degree or another *fitted* to the data that
they are trained on.  This fitting is expected.  A fitted model should be 
parameterized to be the best possible description of the period it was 
trained in.  Some degree of out of sample deterioration of performance 
should be expected from any quantitative model. 

A natural consequence of the fitting process 

- linear models such as @Bailey2014pm and @Bailey2014deSharpe 
  - track the number of trials
    - how do you define a 'trial'?
    
- White's Reality Check from @White2000
- data mining bias and cross validation from @Aronson2006
- BIC and *k*-fold cross validation of @Hastie2009

- out of sample deterioration
