\description{match names in data to a list of partial name matches}
\details{Often, the generic definition of a signal or indicator will include 
partial name matches.  In financial data, common partial matches include
'Close', 'Open', and 'Volume', but there are many more.  

In complex data, additional name information may be added to column names
for example, a symbol or an indicator of some adjustment may be added.

This small utility exists to do the matching in a centralized location 
so that more robust error handling and reporting can be conducted.}
