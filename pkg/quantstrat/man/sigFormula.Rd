\description{generate a signal from a formula}
\details{This code takes advantage of some base R functionality that can treat an R object (in this case the internal mktdata object in quantstrat) as an enfironment or 'frame' using \code{\link{parent.frame}}.  
This allows the columns of the data to be addressed without any major manipulation, simply by column name.  In most cases in quantstrat, this will be either the price/return columns, or columns added by indicators or prior signals.
The formula will return TRUE/FALSE for each row comparison as a time series column which can then be used for rule execution.  The \code{formula} will be evaluated using \code{\link{eval}} as though in an if statement. 

This code is adapted from the approach used by Vijay Vaidyanthan in his PAST/AAII/SIPRO code to construct arbitrary, formulaic, comparisons.  Many thanks to Vijay for sharing his expertise.}

\item{formula}{a logical expression like that used in an if statement, will typically reference column names in \code{mktdata}}
\item{cross}{if TRUE, will return TRUE only for the first observation to match the formula in a run}}
