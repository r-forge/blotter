\usage{
  add.indicator(strategy, name, arguments, parameters =
  NULL, label = NULL, ..., enabled = TRUE, indexnum = NULL,
  store = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{strategy}{an object (or the name of an object) type
  'strategy' to add the indicator to}

  \item{name}{name of the indicator function -- must
  correspond to an R function}

  \item{arguments}{default arguments to be passed to an
  indicator function when executed}

  \item{parameters}{vector of strings naming parameters to
  be saved for apply-time definition,default NULL, only
  needed if you need special names to avoid argument
  collision}

  \item{label}{arbitrary text label for indicator output.
  This will also be used as the name of the indicator list
  when it is stored.  NULL default will be converted to
  '<name>.ind'}

  \item{...}{any other passthru parameters}

  \item{enabled}{TRUE/FALSE whether the indicator is
  enabled for use in applying the strategy, default TRUE}

  \item{indexnum}{if you are updating a specific indicator,
  the \code{label} or the index number in the $indicators
  list to update.}

  \item{store}{TRUE/FALSE whether to store the strategy in
  the .strategy environment, or return it.  default FALSE}
}
\value{
  if \code{strategy} was the name of a strategy, the name.
  It it was a strategy, the updated strategy.

\description{
  Indicators are typically standard technical or
  statistical analysis outputs, such as moving averages,
  bands, or pricing models.
}
\details{
  Indicators are always path-independent, and should be
  constructed from vectorized functions where possible.

  Indicators are applied before signals and rules, and the
  output of indicators may be used as inputs to construct
  signals or fire rules.

  \code{arguments} and \code{parameters} are named lists
  that describe the arguments to be passed to the indicator
  function. \code{arguments} is for defining any
  non-default arguments to be passed to the function named
  in the \code{name} of the indicator. For example, the
  \code{x} argument to a moving average function may be
  defined as \code{x=quote(Cl(mktdata))}

  If you look at the demo scripts, you'll notice that we
  often use \code{quote(mktdata)} in setting up indicators,
  signals, or rules. This tells \R to delay evaluation via
  \code{quote()}, and to use the special variable
  \code{mktdata}.

  \code{mktdata} is typically created internally to
  \code{quantstrat} by looking in the global environment
  for a time series of prices or returns. mktdata may also
  contain other data you've manipulated outside quatstrat,
  though where possible you should use quantstrat to
  contain all the logic for the strategy, to aid in
  maintenance and modifications.

  The use of \code{quote()} tells R to not evaluate what's
  inside the quote until the function is evaluated later.
  By the time that code is evaluated, \code{mktdata} will
  be populated with the correct price information based on
  the contents of whatever portfolio you are evaluating the
  strategy on.

  \code{parameters} is another named list, and normally
  will not be needed. If you have multiple indicator,
  signal, or rule functions share the that \emph{both}
  share the same argument names \emph{and} will need to
  have different values passed to those arguments as
  defined parameters at apply-time, then you may need to
  give them unique names so that delayed evaluation can
  sort it all out for you at apply-time. We will endeavor
  to get an example of named parameters into the demo
  scripts.

  if \code{label} is not supplied, NULL default will be
  converted to '<name>.ind' unless there already exists an
  indicator with that label in which case it will be
  appended with a number (i.e. '<name>.ind.2',
  '<name>.ind.3', etc.). If the indicator function returns
  multiple columns, the label will be \code{\link{paste}}'d
  to either the returned column names or the respective
  column number when applying it to \code{mktdata}.
