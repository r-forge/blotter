\usage{osMaxPos(data, timestamp, orderqty, ordertype, orderside, portfolio, symbol, ruletype, ...)}
\description{order sizing function for position limits and level sizing}
\details{levels are a simplification of more complex (proprietary) 
techniques sometimes used for order sizing.  
the max orderqty returned will be the limit/levels
Obviously the strategy rules could ask for smaller order sizes, 
but this is the default.  If you don't want to use levels, set 
them to 1.

\code{orderqty='all'} in a risk rule will return an order size 
appropriate to flatten the current position.}
\seealso{\code{\link{addPosLimit}},\code{\link{getPosLimit}}}
\note{TODO integrate orderqty='all' into osMaxPos for non-risk exit orders by combining side and pos for exits}
\arguments{\item{data}{an xts object containing market data.  depending on rules, may need to be in OHLCV or BBO formats, and may include indicator and signal information}
\item{timestamp}{timestamp coercible to POSIXct that will be the time the order will be inserted on}
\item{orderqty}{numeric quantity of the desired order, modified by osFUN}
\item{ordertype}{one of "market","limit","stoplimit", or "stoptrailing"}
\item{orderside}{one of either "long" or "short"}
\item{portfolio}{text name of the portfolio to place orders in}
\item{symbol}{identifier of the instrument to place orders for.  The name of any associated price objects (xts prices, usually OHLC) should match these}
\item{ruletype}{one of "risk","order","rebalance","exit","enter", see \code{\link{add.rule}}}
\item{...}{any other passthru parameters}}
