\description{
  When an order gets filled, it should have its status
  moved to 'closed'.
}
\details{
  When an order is updated with a new order, the order
  status should change to 'replaced' with a StatusTime that
  is the same as the one for the new order.  This could
  happen in the case of a traditional Cancel/Replace,
  because of a trailing stop, or in the case of a partial
  fill that needs to enter a replaced order for the
  remainder.

  When a risk event or over-limit event happens, typically
  open orders will be 'canceled'. Possibly new orders will
  be added to close open positions. Many models will also
  want to run a process at the close of market that will
  cancel all open orders.
