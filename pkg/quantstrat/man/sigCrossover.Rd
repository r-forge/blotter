sigCrossover(label, data = mktdata, columns, relationship = c("gt", "lt",

}
\arguments{
  \item{label}{text label to apply to the output}

  \item{data}{data to apply crossover to}

  \item{columns}{named columns to apply crossover of the
  first against the second}

  \item{relationship}{one of c("gt","lt","eq","gte","lte")
  or reasonable alternatives}

  \item{offset1}{numeric offset to be added to the first
  column prior to comparison}

  \item{offset2}{numeric offset to be added to the second

\description{
This will generate a crossover signal, which is a
dimension-reduced version of a comparison signal
\code{\link{sigComparison}}.
