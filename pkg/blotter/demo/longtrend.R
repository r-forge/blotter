# This is a very simple trend following strategy for testing the results of:
# Faber, Mebane T., "A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation." 
# Journal of Risk Management (Spring 2007).
# The article proposes a very simple quantitative market-timing model.  They 
# test the model in sample on the US stock market since 1900 before testing
# it out-of-sample in twenty other markets.

# The article discusses a 200-day simple moving average, which is proposed
# in Jeremy Seigel's book "Stocks for the Long Run" for timing the DJIA.  He 
# concludes that a simple market timing strategy improves the absolute and
# risk adjusted returns over a buy-and-hold strategy.  After all transaction
# costs are included, the timing strategy falls short on the absolute return,
# but still provides a better risk-adjusted return.  Siegel also tests timing on  
# the Nasdaq composite since 1972 and finds better absolute and risk adjusted
# returns.

# The article implements a simpler version of the 200-day SMA, opting for a
# 10-month SMA.  Monthly data is more easily available for long periods of time,
# and the lower granularity should translate to lower transaction costs.  

# The rules of the system are relatively simple:
# - Buy when monthly price > 10-month SMA
# - Sell and move to cash when monthly price < 10-month SMA

# 1. All entry and exit prices are on the day of the signal at the close.
# 2. All data series are total return series including dividends, updated monthly. 
#    For the purposes of this demo, we only use price returns.
# 3. Cash returns are estimated with 90-day commercial paper.  Margin rates for
#    leveraged models are estimated with the broker call rate.  Again, for the
#    purposes of this demo, we ignore interest and leverage.
# 4. Taxes, commissions, and slippage are excluded.

# This simple strategy is different from well-known trend-following systems in
# three respects.  First, there's no shorting.  Positions are converted to cash on
# a 'sell' signal, rather than taking a short position. Second, the entire position
# is put on at trade inception.  No assumptions are made about increasing position
# size as the trend progresses.  Third, there are no stops.  If the trend reverts
# quickly, this system will wait for a sell signal before selling the position.

# Data
# Instead of using total returns data, this demo uses monthly data for the SP500
# downloaded from Yahoo Finance.  We'll use about 10 years of data, starting at 
# the beginning of 1998.
